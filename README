Purpose:
--------

Inject code into ld-linux.so to be executed before targeted binary entry point.

Screenshot:
-----------

$ make clean all
$ cp /lib/ld-linux.so.2 .
$ cp /bin/ls .
$ ./ld-shatner ld-linux.so.2 obj.elf
$ sudo cp ld-hook.so /lib/
$ ./interpatch ls
$ ./ls 
ld-hook <---------------------- output of obj.elf
[...]

The newly generated 'ls' uses our freshly generated 'ld-hook.so' acting
as its dynamic interpreter. The code from 'obj.elf' is executed before
'ls' entry point.
